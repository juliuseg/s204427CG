  <h2>Computer Graphics Questions</h2>

  <h3>(a) Difference between Phong Shading and Phong Lighting</h3>
  <p><strong>Phong Reflection Model (or Phong lighting):</strong> A method for calculating light interaction with surfaces, using ambient, diffuse, and specular components.</p>
  <p><strong>Phong Shading:</strong> Applies the Phong reflection model per pixel, resulting in smoother highlights.</p>
  <p><em>Summary:</em> Phong lighting describes the light reflection model, while Phong shading describes applying this model per fragment for smoother visuals.</p>

  <h3>(b) Difference between Flat, Gouraud, and Phong Shading</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Flat Shading:</strong> Lighting is computed once per face, giving a uniform color.<br>
        <em>Pros:</em> Fast, suitable for faceted surfaces.<br>
        <em>Cons:</em> Unrealistic on curved surfaces.</li>
    <li><strong>Gouraud Shading:</strong> Lighting is calculated per vertex, with colors interpolated across the surface.<br>
        <em>Pros:</em> More realistic than flat shading; efficient.<br>
        <em>Cons:</em> Inaccurate highlights, especially on large polygons.</li>
    <li><strong>Phong Shading:</strong> Lighting is computed per pixel for smooth gradients.<br>
        <em>Pros:</em> High realism, especially for specular highlights.<br>
        <em>Cons:</em> More computationally expensive.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Best for Highlights:</em> Phong shading captures highlights more accurately.</p>

  <h3>(c) Difference between Directional and Point Lights</h3>
  <p><strong>Directional Light:</strong> Represents light from a distant source (e.g., the sun), with parallel rays.</p>
  <p><strong>Point Light:</strong> Represents light emitted from a point, with intensity decreasing by distance.</p>

  <h3>(d) Influence of Eye Position on Shading</h3>
  <p>The eye position affects the specular highlight by influencing the view direction, which determines the highlight’s intensity and placement.</p>

  <h3>(e) Effect of Setting Specular Term to (0,0,0)</h3>
  <p>Setting the specular term to <code>(0,0,0)</code> removes the specular component, making the object appear matte with no reflective highlights.</p>

  <h3>(f) Effect of Increasing the Shininess Exponent (α)</h3>
  <p>Higher shininess exponent values make specular highlights sharper and smaller, simulating smooth surfaces like metal.</p>
